# GAMBIT
Gambit is a terminal-based flash card utility written in C.  
Some of its attractive qualities are:
* Self-contained (no dependencies)
* You can use multiple decks simultaneously
* Performance Metrics
* Profiles to remember session settings
* Vim key bindings as well as default bindings for extremely quick navigation
* Configurable Timer for each card and the whole game
* Minor Animations

Overall, Gambit aims to be a lightweight and highly functional learning utility
with minor cosmetics.
