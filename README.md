* Anki deck file support
* Performance Metrics
* Profiles to remember session settings
* Vim key bindings as well as default bindings for quick navigation
* Deck builder
* Configurable Timer for each card and the whole game
* Minor Animations
  Overall, Gambit aims to be a lightweight and highly functional learning utility
with minor cosmetics.
