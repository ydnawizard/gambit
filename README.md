# GAMBIT
Gambit is a terminal-based flash card utility written in C with a simple ncurses gui.  
Some of its attractive qualities are:
* You can use multiple decks simultaneously
* Performance Metrics
* Multiple choice support
* Save/Load session settings to avoid repetitive configuring
* Vim key bindings as well as default bindings for extremely quick navigation
* Configurable card and game timer
* Minor Animations

Overall, Gambit aims to be a lightweight and highly functional learning utility
with minor cosmetics.
